# Preface

This app, "Preface", was created for enterence into the 2018 FBLA Mobile Application Development Competition. This app allows a facticious school to manage the issuance of books at a school library. Students of the school can check out and reserve books, and they recieve a notification when books are overdue. A map of the school library along with other information is shown.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this application, the device being used must run Android SDK version 16 (Jellybean 4.1) or later. The application can be run on tablets, but it is optomized for phones running Android SDK version 25 (Nougat 7.1.2). Internet connection is required for this app to function correctly. Without a reliable connection, the user may have trouble logging in and images may take a long time to load.

### Installation

Download this app off the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.walowtech.fblaapplication&hl=en) for Android devices or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0791V9Q1K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1516156414&sr=8-1&keywords=Matthew+Walowski) for Kindle devices.

### Running the App

An account is required to access any point further than the login screen. All information collected is completley confidential.

### Errors

Preface has been tested extensively to remove any bugs that may exist. However, rare errors may occur outside of the app that reduce functionality temporarily.
If any type of server error is seen on the app, this is a problem with the database that stores all book and user information. This is not a bug in the app, and is purely the result of either a bad internet connection on the userâ€™s end or the server being temporarily down. If this occurs, the user should check his or her network connection, close the app, and reopen it.  It is important that the app is completely closed by launching the recent applications menu and swiping the app to the right.
If the server error persists, wait a few hours before opening the app again.
